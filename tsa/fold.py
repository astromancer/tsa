    segment an array at given wsize, overlap,

    keywords are passed to np.pad used to fill up the array to the required length.  This
    method works on multidimentional and masked array as well.

    keyword arguments are passed to np.pad to fill up the elements in the last window (default is
    symmetric padding).

    NOTE: When overlap is nonzero, the array returned by this function will have multiple entries
    **with the same memory location**.  Beware of this when doing inplace arithmetic operations.

    N, wsize, overlap = 100, 10, 5

    k = 0
    q[0,overlap+k] *= 10
